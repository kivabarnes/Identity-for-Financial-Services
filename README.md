# Digital Identity for Financial Services

A blockchain-based solution for secure, user-centric identity management across financial institutions.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized digital identity framework specifically designed for financial services. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a secure, privacy-preserving system that enables seamless identity verification, secure credential management, and transparent data sharing across the financial ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Identity Verification Contract
- Validates user identity through trusted verification sources
- Implements multi-factor authentication protocols
- Creates cryptographic proofs of verification without storing sensitive data
- Supports various levels of identity assurance for different financial services
- Maintains compliance with KYC/AML regulations globally

### Credential Management Contract
- Issues verifiable claims and attestations about user identity and financial status
- Manages digital credentials from financial institutions and trusted third parties
- Enables selective disclosure of personal information
- Supports credential revocation and updates
- Provides cryptographic verification of credential authenticity

### Consent Tracking Contract
- Records explicit user permissions for data sharing
- Implements granular consent mechanisms for specific data elements
- Maintains immutable audit trail of all consent actions
- Enables users to modify or revoke consent at any time
- Enforces regulatory compliance with privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### Fraud Prevention Contract
- Analyzes transaction patterns for suspicious activities
- Implements risk scoring algorithms for identity verification attempts
- Maintains privacy-preserving reputation systems
- Enables collaborative fraud detection across institutions
- Provides early warning system for potential identity theft
